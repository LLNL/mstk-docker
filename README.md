# mstk-docker

## Description
This project runs the Granta MI:Scripting Toolkit V2 for Python inside a docker container for develpment purposes.


## Requiremenets
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A My Granta account

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have docker installed.
    - [Download for Windows or Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    - [Instructions for Linux flavors](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. [Download the MIScriptingToolkit V2](https://grantadesign.com/industry/support/).
    - Click on "Restricted" on the left side and login with your My Granta account.
    - Click on "Download" on the left side in the Download Software section.
    - Select the Granta MI version that you require. The MI:Scripting Toolkit V2 requires  at least Granta MI v11.0.
    - Select "Options".
    - Scroll down to "MI:Scripting Toolkit v2.0 for Python" and download the zip file.
1. Copy the zip file to the `Toolkit_zip_files` folder. 
    > **_NOTE:_** Currently only version 2.0 of the scripting toolkit is supported.

1. Run `docker-compose build` to build the container.
    > **_NOTE:_** If you would like to install additional python packages into the image you can list these in the included `requirements.txt` file. You will then need to run a build command again.

## Running the container

1. Run `docker-compose run mstk` to run the container and drop into an interactive shell. This requires you be in the directory with the included `docker-compose.yml` file. 
    - Alternatively, you can run `docker run -it mstk` from anywhere, given you have built the image.
1. Run `docker-compose run mstk python` to run the container and drop into a Python REPL. 
    - Alternatively, you can uncomment the `command` portion of the `docker-compose.yml` file and run `docker-compose run mstk` to acheive the same effect.
    - Alternatively, you can run `docker run -it mstk python` from anywhere, given you have built the image.
    - You can verify you have the toolkit available by typing `from GRANTA_MIScriptingToolkit import granta as gdl` into your REPL.

## Options

- If you would like to mount a folder from your host into the mstk docker container, uncomment the `volumes` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file and put in the path to the folder you would like to mount.

## Documentation

- The Granta:MI Scripting Toolkit documentation can be found in the zip file that was downloaded. Unzip the file and open up the docs index file at `MI_ScriptingToolkit_v2.0.0_for_Python/HTML5/index.htm`.

## Extending this image

If you would like to build upon this docker image you must follow the above build instructions first listed in the **Getting Started** section. Then in your Dockerfile begin with `FROM mstk`. That's it! Your new docker image will now have the Granta:MI Scripting Toolkit available in the system Python environment.
